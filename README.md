# Dotfiles
Simple set of dotfiles for my desktop configuration (Manjaro KDE on Linux 4.19)

## Instructions
clone the repository in a local directory called `.dotfiles`, move inside the directory and run the `install` script. If some of the links can't be created, you might want to backup those files, remove them and rerun the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jschiavon/dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
./install
```
